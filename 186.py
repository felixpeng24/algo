"""
Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that 
the difference between the sum of the subsets is as small as possible.

For example, given [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], return the sets {10, 25} and {5, 15, 20}, 
which has a difference of 5, which is the smallest possible difference.
