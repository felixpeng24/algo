"""
Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 + 9.

"""

# go from biggest squarev value that is still equvalent, subtract, and go down the list of combinations since you want the smallest list?
